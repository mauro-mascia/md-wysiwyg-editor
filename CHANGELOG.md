## [0.3.3] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **Send to Claude line numbers after edits**: the source snapshot used to resolve line numbers is now refreshed on every save together with the line map. Previously it was refreshed only on open and on external changes, so line references went stale after editing in the WYSIWYG view (for example after reflowing lines).

---

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Frontmatter list editing**: Added support for editing list fields directly in the frontmatter panel.
- **Structured frontmatter editing**: Improved editing for nested object metadata and richer structured frontmatter values.
- **Theme selection experience**: Improved the Markdown theme selection command with clearer localized labels.

### Fixed

- **Table grid selector**: Improved table grid picker interaction when inserting tables from the toolbar.
- **Heading sticky title**: Fixed sticky heading layout behavior in the editor.

### Changed

- **Documentation refresh**: Updated English and Simplified Chinese README content with current feature descriptions and screenshots.

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Heading sticky position**: Reverted the position adjustment that caused incorrect left offset. Heading sticky title now uses the original positioning logic.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **TOC z-index**: Increased TOC panel z-index to 1200 to prevent heading-sticky-title from covering it on narrow screens.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Editor plugin architecture**: Complete refactoring with heading fold/collapse, heading sticky, code block enhancement, and TOC optimization.
- **Frontmatter panel**: Editable frontmatter panel with inline editing support.
- **Color theme support**: New `markdownWysiwyg.colorTheme` setting to override VS Code's default theme. Use Command Palette "Select Color Theme" to browse and select from installed themes.
- **Custom theme support**: Define custom color themes via `markdownWysiwyg.customThemes` configuration in `.vscode/settings.json`. Select themes from Command Palette with "Select Color Theme".
- **Table wrap mode**: New `markdownWysiwyg.tableWrap` setting with three modes: `normal` (default, avoid word breaks), `aggressive` (break long words), `none` (disable wrapping).
- **Tab key optimization**: Code blocks insert 4 spaces, list items support indentation to next level, normal text inserts 2 spaces.
- **Custom theme documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/custom-themes.md` (Chinese) and `docs/en/custom-themes.md` (English).

### Fixed

- **Tab key in lists**: Pressing Tab in a list now correctly indents to the next level instead of scrolling to the top.
- **Tab key in code blocks and text**: Fixed Tab key behavior to insert spaces instead of triggering browser default action.
- **Table word break**: Added `word-break: keep-all` to table cells to prevent mid-character line breaks in CJK text.
- **List Tab at deepest level**: Fixed issue where pressing Tab at the deepest list indentation level would scroll to the top.

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Scroll position restored on tab switch**: switching away from a Markdown file and back no longer resets the scroll position to the top. The editor now persists the scroll offset via the VS Code WebView state API and restores it when the panel becomes visible again (via `visibilitychange`). Also handles WebView recreation on VS Code restart.

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Auto-reload on external file changes**: the editor now instantly reflects changes made by AI tools (e.g. Claude Code) or any external program without needing to close and reopen the file. Previously, writes from the same VS Code Extension Host were silently ignored due to VS Code's internal deduplication; atomic writes (rename-based) also caused the file watcher to stop tracking the file after the first replacement. Fixed by switching to Node.js `fs.watch` on the parent directory.
- **IME input**: prevent Chinese/Japanese/Korean intermediate composition states from triggering premature auto-saves, which caused duplicate or garbled characters.

### Added

- **Image path autocomplete**: type `./`, `../`, or `@/` in the image URL input to get smart path suggestions; image files show a 32 px thumbnail preview in the dropdown.
- **`@/` alias for image paths**: images referenced as `@/images/foo.png` (workspace root) are now correctly displayed in the editor.

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Path autocomplete**: type `@/`, `./`, or `../` inside inline code to trigger smart path suggestions
- **Hierarchical directory browsing**: path suggestions show the current directory level; selecting a folder drills into the next level
- **File-type icons**: the suggestion dropdown shows color-coded vscode-icons for 9 file types (folder, TypeScript, JavaScript, Markdown, JSON, CSS, HTML, image, and generic file)
- **`#line-number` jump in links**: links such as `README.md#27` or `README.md#27-30` jump directly to the specified line in the target file

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **In-editor search** (`Cmd/Ctrl+F`): FindBar with real-time highlighting via CSS Custom Highlight API; navigate with `Enter` / `Shift+Enter`, dismiss with `Esc`
- **Link popup redesign**: single-card UI with view / edit modes; supports `@/` workspace paths and `#anchor` in-page links
- **In-page anchor navigation** (`#heading`): GitHub-compatible slug, smooth scroll
- **Global search navigation**: clicking a VS Code search result scrolls the WYSIWYG editor to the matching position
- **Code block full-screen editor**: textarea + pre overlay with syntax highlighting, fade-in/out animation; writes back to ProseMirror on close
- **Mermaid diagram rendering** (mermaid 11.x): inline preview, code/preview toggle, zoom, pan, full-screen lightbox

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Image support**: paste, drag-and-drop, or file picker to insert images; local storage with MD5 deduplication or custom server upload
- **Image NodeView**: selection border, lightbox zoom, toolbar for alt-text editing, rename, and delete
- **Internationalization**: English + Simplified Chinese; platform-aware shortcuts (Mac ⌘/⇧/⌥ vs Windows Ctrl/Shift/Alt)
- **Settings icon** (gear) in the toolbar opens the VS Code settings panel for this extension
